                            where I worked on a machine learning model to train models using datasets of red and white
                            variants of the Portuguese ”Vinho Verde” wine in order to
                            predict the wine rating as accurately as possible. The dataset
                            contains 11 inputs of objective tests (e.g.
                            PH values) and one target rating, which is based on
                            sensory data(median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine
                            experts). The project explored different approaches to classification algorithms and their advantages/disadvantages in the context of this dataset.

                        <p>
                            As part of the Third-Year Embedded Systems course we were required to design, using a list of available sensor, an IoT device
                            which is connected to a online platform using the MQTT protocol for lightweight data transfer. We came up with SwimTime, an device which
                            using an ultra-sonic distance sensor would act as a swimming companion by measuring lap times and speed. This device would then transfer the 
                            data to a online Dashboard where the user would be able to monitor his/her progress in the swimming pool. The device was designed as a proof-of-concept 
                            and implemented on a breadboard.
